# Blockchain in Java
Building a blockchain with smart contracts using Java instead of Ethereum and Solidity. Both Java and Solidity create bytecode and ABI, instead of invooking an ethereum virtual machine to execute the smart contracts written in Solidity, the Java blockchain invokes a Java virtual machine or JVM to execute the smart cotnracts written in Java.

Java is matured language and is deployed in many financial instituions, in addition Java has the large community of libraries or packages to implement any real life scenario on the Web3 stack but using Java. In addition, Java supports API consumption, so oracles will not be needed.
